Handmade by Beadlight in the UK, the Cirrus collection was originally designed for use in private jet aircraft, and first and business class cabins. The range has proved incredibly successful in hotels, private residences and mega yachts. Built to the exacting standards demanded by the aeropsace industry, each Beadlight reading light is made by hand and wrapped in English leather with hand stitching.
- Ideal as a bedhead light, the luxurious fitting provides two brightness settings for reading.
- Can be mounted to existing walls and bed heads.
- Simple installation is required by an electrician.
- Energy Efficient. These LED lights become the perfect solution to make substantial energy savings.
- The wall lights use 1.4 watts of energy and require a 12v transformer, not included.
- Previously available only to architects and interior designers, the Beadlight collection is now available to the public exclusively through Dunlin.
- Overall Length from wall 45cm

Key Features - Mango Timber
The timber used in this piece is sustainably sourced Mango Wood. Each plank is individually treated in a computer controlled kiln to reduce the chance of any cracks or warping in its long future as a furniture component.
This piece has been handcrafted by one of our Vast Masters, these individual cabinet makers have been manufacturing Vast products for over a decade. Using traditional joinery techniques to maximise the timber's natural beauty is a big part of the unique look of each Vast product. We call this "working with the grain". After the joinery is complete it is then hand sanded and hand polished with several coats of high grade German lacquer so it will last for generations!
Country of Origin: India
Product Care - Timber
Hardwood is a natural material which reacts to its environment and although our manufacturing process allows for normal expansion and contraction, extreme high or low humidity may cause more swelling than normal. To minimise movement and ensure longevity of your purchase we recommend taking good care of your piece as outlined below:
Dust regularly with a clean cotton cloth;
Use tablecloths, table runners and coasters to help prevent  scratches to the surface and wipe up any spills immediately;
To nourish and protect your furniture we recommend waxing with a natural beeswax every 6-12 months.
Only use natural wax, oil or water based cleaning products. Do not use solvent based cleaning products that may contain silicone or alcohol, as this may react and permanently damage the lacquer.
Do not expose to fragrant oils, insect repellent lotion, or nail polish remover as these are often solvent based and will damage the lacquer
Avoid placing your furniture near fireplaces, in direct sunlight or under heating/cooling vents.
Do not leave hot items or ice cold items directly on the surface of the table as water marking may occur.
Any metal work featuring on your product has been powder coated. Any damage to the surface should be contained as soon as possible to prevent rusting.

Designed with simplicity in mind, the Hoyt Chair is anything but basic. Keep conversations flowing by placing a pair of these chairs in a room. The square silhouette and smart lines look even better when two chairs sit together.

DURAWOOD® Porch Swing by Pawleys Island
Eco-Friendly DURAWOOD®: DURAWOOD® is a 3/4"-1" lumber, compared to 1/2" thick offered by our competitors, that's made from densely compressed recycled industrial waste. It contains no waste-wood fiber so it won't absorb any water and won't rot, splinter or crack. DURAWOOD® is fade resistant and will never require paint, stain or any kind of sealant.Stainless Steel Hardware: High quality 316 marine-grade stainless steel hardware is used on our outdoor furniture, compared to 304 marine-grade used by our competitors, for superior rust resistance. All hardware is painted to match the color of the furniture and strategically place to conceal each bolt.Mortise and Tenon Joints: We use this ancient form of carpentry, where board meets board, to allow our furniture to fit together and help make it sturdier; rather than just being held together with nuts and bolts.

Wood And Finish Options
We believe believe that wood should never be stained. Every item that we meticulously handcraft is made using 100% solid wood, in the species of wood that you select. A Walnut item will be Solid Walnut Wood, not muddy walnut colored chemical pigments applied over a cheaper material. Our Primary finish is our Proprietary Organic Blend of natural Oils and Waxes. We do not add any chemicals, thinners, pigments or metallic driers to our finish. In fact, our finish is actually made using 100% food grade ingredients!On heavy use items, such as dining tables, we use a hard coating finish that has zero-VOC content and is certified for food contact.You may at any point speak with us to select a different finish or to ask questions and get answers.
Shipping
We know buying furniture from TY Fine Furniture is a long term investment and that our customers want their items on time and in perfect condition.We want the best experience for all our customers. Because of this, we have developed a shipping process that results in consistently excellent results. Currently, all items are designed to be lightly disassembled for shipping. This means that there is some light assembly involved with most items. Most items it means attaching the legs, on beds its a little more complex, but still very simple. By lightly disassembling every item, it also means that you can easily and quickly move the individually boxed parts into your room with ease, our target for each box is a maximum weight of 75 lbs. Every individual box is sized to go through smallest elevator and around tightest corners. Our average bed frame takes 30-45 minutes to assemble, our customers are always elated about how easy it is, and how sturdy and durable the resulting furniture becomes.

Eliza Fan
Sale
Sold out
Designed by Chicago architect Stephen Katz in 2013, the Eliza blends a beautiful technically derived form with superior function and movement. The unique blade shape is designed to maximize air movement at the outer edge of the blade. The result is more efficient air velocity rings, less blade drag and greater motor optimization. Equally important is the Eliza fan’s stationary visual statement which combines modern utility with minimalist geometry.
Dimensions 56" D
Additional Details•Energy efficient, ultra-quiet, six-speed and reversible DC motor with new reliable technology.•Damp location finishes: brushed nickel and gloss white.•Blades available in Gloss White, Brushed Nickel, Walnut, Barnwood or Gray Ash.•Constructed of cast aluminum, polycarbonate and heavy stamped steel.

IMPORTANT - Lead Times & Pre-Orders
Lead Times May Apply - Stock Availability:
As we are an online only store we hold our homewares and smaller furniture items at our warehouse in Perth.  The majority of our larger furniture items are delivered directly from our amazing brand partners. We work very closely with them to understand stock availability, but we also don’t like to disappoint our customers if it is out of stock or if there is a lead time as stock levels change frequently.  Therefore if an item has a "lead times may apply' message this means they may be in stock or have a lead time of 4 - 12 weeks, it just means we need to double check stock availability as they are super popular.  Feel free however to place an order now as we also guarantee a full refund (within the week of purchase), if we contact you to advise the item is out of stock and/or lead times are longer than expected.
Pre-Orders:
We do however highly recommend placing a pre-order as items can sell out prior to shipments arriving, and this will ensure you receive your piece in the next shipment.  If you would like estimated lead times, shipping quotes or any other information please try the instant chat or click on the Get In Touch button and we will get back to you as soon as possible.  We can arrange a 50% deposit for all pre-order items, with balance due prior to delivery.
Lead Times:
Cranmore Home & Co quote an approximate lead time for the receipt of any orders based on information provided by their partner suppliers at time of purchase. Circumstances beyond our control, may cause disruptions and lead to a delay in your order being delivered on quoted lead times once an order is placed.  We will keep you as up to date as possible on any changes to estimated lead times.
Shipping & Delivery Fees
Delivery:
What we can promise is that we will ship all in-stock products from our Perth warehouse within 3 business days and in the case of bespoke or out-of-stock products, customers will be emailed as soon as possible with an estimated shipping date.  As we are an online business and many of our larger items are delivered directly from our suppliers, in this case we endeavour to ensure that our suppliers dispatch in-stock items within 5-10 business days. Delivery all depends on where it is coming from and where you live. We generally allow 7-14 days most metro areas and for many country locations, WA, NT & Tasmania please allow 2-3 weeks. Some of our items are available for collection from our Perth warehouse and will have this information on the product page if available.
NOTE: Due to COVID19 there may be delivery delays for in stock items from our suppliers that are out of our control. We would recommend adding an additional 5-7 days for dispatch as warehouses are currently inundated and 2 - 3 days to any delivery as a rough guide for items that are in stock. For pre-orders from suppliers with stock coming from international manufacturers please keep in mind, the current worldwide increase in demand and restrictions for international ocean freight container exports.  This is affecting supply chains extensively and sometimes lead time extensions are out of our control.
Shipping:
All items have a flat fee based on weight, dimensions and delivery location. This cost ranges from $9.95 - $250 for metro areas throughout Australia and this will be applied at checkout if required. For regional areas throughout Australia or for some super heavy/bulky/fragile items you may incur an additional fee, this will be advised after checkout, prior to dispatch if required. If you would like a quote tailored for your order prior to check out please contact us . Some of our items are available for collection from our Perth warehouse and will have this information on the product page if available.
PLEASE NOTE: Delivery is to your post box or front door only.  If you require white glove service of delivery, placement of item and removal of packaging please contact us to arrange.  Additional costs will be incurred.

Adding product to your cart
This item is part of our Considered CollectionElegantly sculptural, the Molloy collection of dining tables, chairs, shelving and coffee tables feature fluid detailing inspired by a rare act of nature.The idea for the artfully rounded joinery, where two elements meet and seamlessly become one, comes from the unusual meeting of two rivers to form the Molloy River in Western Australia – a place where Adam Goodrum hand-built a holiday home with his family. The Molloy collection is available in a variety of timber finishes.Winner of the Good Design Awards 2016.
Product made from sustainably sourced materials with a lower environmental impact than conventional alternatives.

By Adam Goodrum
A firm believer that every environment is defined by the objects within it, Adam Goodrum designs with the philosophy that an object must therefore justify its existence – through its story and detailing. For this reason, his designs celebrate process and craftsmanship, and accentuate components and joinery to create functional pieces with spirit and personality. In recent years, Goodrum’s work has been awarded a host of design accolades including the NGV Rigg Prize, Vogue x Alessi Design Prize, Indesign Luminary Award and the Idea Awards Editor’s Medal. He has also been commissioned to design pieces for several global luxury brands including Veuve Clicquot, Alessi and Cappellini.

Description
The Jack leather and wood stool is the perfect compliment to a beautiful kitchen island or bar. It is equally suited to a relaxed modern Los Angeles home as it is to a New York City apartment.  The steel footrest is an added comfort for resting your heels.  Thoughtful detailing enhances the simple design of this Lostine collection. Each thick leather seat has its own character and variations lending to the appeal of the material. The leather will vary in color and darken with age, like a great bag or a favorite pair of boots. The frame is made of a hard maple wood and sealed to protect the wood but keep the beauty of the wood's natural color. Made in the USA.
This item is non-returnable. Excluded from shipping promotions.

Details
+ Our Harness leather ages over time, in what we call a "living finish". Scratches, dents, folds and marks occur naturally in the leather. We do not view these marks as defects. Please note that hue and color varies between hides. Since each side of leather is different, the shade and texture of the leather will vary with each chair. Finish samples available upon request.
+
Orders of 3 or more stools may require a freight shipment.
Please inquire with any questions regarding freight deliveries.
CARE
+ We recommend using a microfiber dust cloth to care for wood pieces. Kindly avoid additional cleaners and products.
+
Please care for your leather products with a soft cloth and leather cleaner.
Please be advised that exposure to sunlight and water will darken the leather.

FAQs
What does 'Made-to-Order' mean?
Made-to-order means that once we receive your order, it gets included in a production run of that item and when it is completed, it ships to you directly. This reduces waste (we don’t overproduce inventory or cut into materials that aren’t needed), and keeps our small, hardworking team organized. We have a limited number of people on our team and a made-to-order workflow, so we are only able to produce a certain number of items each week in order to maintain our lead times.
Can you rush my order?
We are unable to rush any made-to-order items, however from time to time we have a small stock of this lamp available on our Ready to Ship page.
As an designer or architect, do I qualify for a trade discount?
We offer trade services to interior designers, decorators and architects. Members of our Trade Program enjoy an exclusive discount, complimentary samples, tax exemption and more. Click here to apply.
How do I request a quote for this item?
Please submit a quote request via this form, and one of our dedicated account managers will provide your quote within 24-48 hours of your request submission. Quotes are valid for 30 days.
Can I order a finish sample?
We have swatches of our furniture materials available. To order a sample, click here.
What is your return policy?
Items in unused condition may be returned for a full refund after 14 days from when you receive your order, minus the cost of shipping. Learn more about how to start a return here.

Offering direct as well as ambient light, the lamp's adjustable head and arm feature an opal diffuser and dimmer function that effortlessly alters the volume of light. Display on your desk, shelf or sideboard.
Also available as a Wall Lamp and Floor Lamp.

We process orders Monday - Friday between 9.30am and 5pm.  Please contact us with any order enquiries during these hours at hello@somedaydesigns.co.uk or give us a call on 020 8305 7265.
DELIVERY
For items we carry in stock, you should receive your order within 3-5 working days, depending on where you are based in the UK.
Due to the bespoke nature and wide choice of our lighting and furniture items, most are not held in stock. We will specifically order these in for you as per the finish, size or colour you have selected at the point of order.  Delivery times vary by product and design partner, so please find the relevant lead time information on the product page. Once orders have been received into our warehouse we will arrange final delivery with you.
We offer a simple and competitive delivery rate:

Orders over £50
Free
Please note, Highlands and Islands deliveries are not included in the UK charges above and may be charged an additional fee so please check prices with us prior to ordering.
There are rare occasions where factors out of our control can delay a delivery, so we ask for your patience in these circumstances and we promise to keep you up to date should this apply to your order.
Overseas delivery
We can deliver overseas and will need to offer a quotation. Please contact us for a quote, with the details of your order and its destination hello@somedaydesigns.co.uk | 020 8305 7265.
Delivery Partners
We use Royal Mail, UPS or APC to deliver accessories, small furniture & lighting. Delivery is Monday to Friday, we will notify you once the item has been sent and provide tracking details where applicable.
For large furniture orders such as sofas, we use a specialist furniture home delivery team, who are experts in handling furniture to make sure your delivery goes as smoothly as possible. This service is a 'white glove' service and includes the following:
Confirmation of your two-hour delivery window the working day before your agreed delivery date
An estimated time of arrival on the day of delivery (this is a guide not a guarantee due to traffic and possible difficulties in earlier deliveries which are out of our control)
Two man delivery team
Unpack and position the furniture in the room of your choice
Remove and recycle packaging
We ask that you check the dimensions at the delivery address for access (including doors, corridors and stairs) as well as the area of intended use, before you order to ensure that the product is the right size for you and to enable us to deliver your order successfully.  You must provide a clear route to the room of choice removing any obstacles from the exterior and communal areas.  Goods that fail to fit into your property at the point of delivery are your responsibility as we have no control over this.  Please also advise us of any parking restrictions, red routes or width restrictions ahead of the delivery.
Access Checks
If you are looking to buy a sofa but concerned that it might not fit through your doorway or stairwell then it's worth considering using our access check service.  For an additional fee a trained member of our team will visit your home to measure up, giving you piece of mind before you buy.  Get in touch to find out pricing and further details.
Removal of existing furniture
As part of the white glove service we can also remove your old furniture for an extra fee, which must be arranged with us prior to delivery.  We reserve the right to refuse collection of unhygienic furniture for health and safety reasons.  Please get in touch to find out further details.
RETURNS
We offer a no quibble returns policy* - so you are fully entitled to a refund within 14 working days of delivery.
*except for the products described below referred to as made-to-order
Please get in touch with us if you wish to return an item and we will advise how best to proceed hello@somedaydesigns.co.uk | 020 8305 7265.
We ask that the product you return is in new, unused, condition with all the original packaging and product tags still attached.  For small accessory items being returned by post or courier, we advise you use an insured, signed for service in case the parcel fails to reach us.  Unfortunately we cannot cover the cost of return postage, unless the item is faulty.
Someday Designs reserve the right to refuse a refund on any item if we find that the product has not been returned to us in fully resalable condition.
All accurately returned products will be credited to the original purchaser’s credit or debit card, excluding delivery costs, within 7 working days once received and checked. We will email you confirmation once the refund has been made.
Damaged or faulty items
We make every effort to deliver your items to you in perfect condition. We recommend that you check your delivery as soon as it is received. If there is a problem with your order please contact hello@somedaydesigns.co.uk | 020 8305 7265 as soon as possible so that we can resolve it for you promptly. We may ask you to send images of the fault and it is advisable to keep the original packaging in which the item arrived.
Returns Procedure for Furniture Orders Only
Should you wish to return a furniture item we will arrange to collect this item from you and will apply an appropriate collection charge, which will be deducted from the refund value when processed. To arrange a collection please contact our team hello@somedaydesigns.co.uk | 020 8305 7265.
Products, which fall into the following categories, will not be refunded unless they are proven to be faulty;
Any goods made to order or not normally kept in stock at Someday Designs (see more information below)
Self assembly furniture cannot be returned once assembly is part or fully completed
Made-to-order products
Due to the bespoke nature of the products we supply and the diverse choice of finishes and materials, goods are often made-to-order by our design partners and imported from overseas.  Therefore it is not possible to return these items.
We will contact you via email to confirm your made-to-order details to ensure all specifications are completely correct before we place the order with the supplier. Following delivery, made-to-order goods are non-returnable unless we have not supplied the correct item or specification as per the order confirmation email.
Made-to-order pieces are furniture and lighting items whereby you select a fabric, colour, material finish or size at point of order.

Pride in Bench-Built CraftsmanshipOur painted furniture is the best in class. Our builders hand-select each piece of wood that makes it into a Maine Cottage piece of furniture.

Every square inch of the furniture is hand sanded to a smooth finish.
Read More About Our QUalit
Why We ShineThe sanding between coats is the labor-intensive step that sets our smooth finish apart. Finishers are meticulously trained to leave enough shine to allow for easy maintenance but not so much that it becomes highly reflective and susceptible to finger printing. Our paint finish also knows how to age gracefully. Over the years, it develops a patina of surface scratches that add to the charm of our furniture’s cottage style.

Professional delivery and installation is available for every product we sell. We would be happy to coordinate delivery and installation for you.
Extended warranties are usually very inexpensive and can save you thousands in the future.
It's simple and inexpensive to purchase extended warranties and one of the smartest ways to protect your investment.
Furniture
can be large, heavy and expensive. You probably don't have the special tools or expertise needed to fix them in a crisis. If you can spare a few thousand dollars without batting an eyelash for new
furniture
should they break tomorrow, don't buy a warranty. But if you're like most of us, protect yourself by purchasing inexpensive extended warranties when you buy a new product and save yourself big money in the long run.

PRODUCT CARE
Rotomolded Plastic General Cleaning: Rinse with clean water and dry with a clean, soft cloth. Avoid using abrasive cleanser that may scratch the plastic. Use a tub/tile/sink cleaner; non-abrasive, all-purpose cleaner; or a paste of baking soda and water. Apply the cleaner to the surface or on a damp sponge and rub gently. The plastic injection moulding process produces large numbers of parts of high quality with great accuracy, very quickly. Plastic material in the form of granules is melted until soft enough to be injected under pressure to fill a mould. The result is that the shape is exactly copied. Kannoa products are UV Resistant, and in this case Recyclable.
Simplicity and Style
Designed for durability, practicality and style.

Professional delivery and installation is available for every product we sell. We would be happy to coordinate delivery and installation for you.
Extended warranties are usually very inexpensive and can save you thousands in the future.
It's simple and inexpensive to purchase extended warranties and one of the smartest ways to protect your investment.
Furniture
can be large, heavy and expensive. You probably don't have the special tools or expertise needed to fix them in a crisis. If you can spare a few thousand dollars without batting an eyelash for new
furniture
should they break tomorrow, don't buy a warranty. But if you're like most of us, protect yourself by purchasing inexpensive extended warranties when you buy a new product and save yourself big money in the long run.
Shop Smart, Buy Local.

Shipping Policy
Shipping
At QW Furniture, we offer 4 different options for you to get your new furniture.
FREE in-store pickup. Pretty self explanatory here, you can pick up any purchase at our store, of course, free of charge.
Local delivery. If your residence is within our local delivery radius, your furniture will be delivered by our local team. This is a 2-man, white glove delivery service.
Long distance curbside flat rate $199 delivery. This service is available for those who live outside our local delivery radius and wish to have their furniture delivered as efficiently as possible. Our curbside service is just how it sounds, curbside. Our friendly driver will assist with unloading your furniture from the delivery truck onto your curb or driveway but that is where this service stops. This service does not include a lift-gate.
Long distance in-home flat rate $399 delivery. This service is available for those who live outside our local delivery radius and wish to have a 'white glove', in-home delivery experience. With our White Glove service, our friendly driver(s) will unload your furniture and move your items into the desired room where they will perform all required assembly. This service includes complete in-home delivery of all of your purchased items and removal of any waste packaging materials.
Please allow an additional 1-4 weeks for delivery. Exact transit time depends on your destination and the mode of transit required for your order.
Once your order is built and ready to be delivered, you will be contacted to set up a delivery time. When the delivery date arrives, please make sure there is someone at your home or office to receive your items.
Please make sure that the item(s) on your order will fit through your doorways and stairways to ensure delivery is possible. Restocking fees may apply if your order is not able to be delivered.
Our drivers are not allowed to haul away, move or disassemble your existing furniture. Please have the room ready for your new furniture.
If a customer needs to delay shipment of their order, storage fees and/or transfer fees may apply.
Your delivery location must be accessible by semi trailer and be clear of snow. Please contact us if you have a difficult access and we will work together on the best solution.
Furniture Inspection
We do not use any common carrier freight companies for any of our Amish Furniture. We choose to only work with experienced individual drivers that really know how to handle high quality furniture.
All of our Amish Furniture is also heavily wrapped in blankets during the shipping and delivery process. Because of these precautions, shipping damage is extremely low.
It is your responsibility to inspect your furniture to ensure that it has not been damaged during delivery. The furniture should be unpackaged before the delivery team leaves your residence to ensure there is no damage. If damage has occurred, please contact us immediately - while the delivery team is still at your residence. The quickest and most appropriate solution may be to bring the item back to the shop right away. Any damage not reported within 24 hours of delivery will not be covered.
Build Times
As soon as you complete your purchase with QW Furniture, your order is sent immediately for production. Please see the individual product pages for detailed build time estimates. Stated expected lead times are our best estimation based on current information and are not guaranteed.
* Due to unprecedented global supply chain challenges, we have been experiencing some delays.
Please remember our furniture is built by hand and must pass rigorous quality checks. The build process doesn't happen overnight but we do take great pride in the quality of our furniture and strive to meet our posted build times. Cancellation is not permitted due to a build time delay.
Cancellation Requests
If you wish to cancel your order, you may do so up to 3 days after placing your order for a full refund. Refunds will be issued back onto the same payment method used during the initial order process. Cancellation requests after 3 days may not be accepted due to work having begun your order. A 30% restocking fee to cancel after the 3 day period may apply.
Returns
First and foremost, we take care of our customers. We would not have a 4.7 star review rating on Google if we didn't.
Our return policy is as follows: 7 day return policy for in-stock items. If an in-stock purchase is returned in-store within 7 days you will be eligible for a full refund. If 7 days have gone by since your purchase, unfortunately we can’t offer you a refund or exchange. If your item is a special order, a 30% re-stocking fee will apply if returned within 7 days. Shipping charges are non-refundable. If you do not return in-store, you will be responsible for all return shipping charges. Note: Return shipping may not be the same cost as our flat rate shipping to you.
To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be in the original packaging. Several types of goods are exempt from being returned. Perishable goods such as food, flowers, newspapers or magazines cannot be returned. We also do not accept products that are intimate or sanitary goods, hazardous materials, or flammable liquids or gases.
Additional non-returnable items include gift cards, stain and some health and personal care items.
To complete your return, we require a receipt or proof of purchase.
Please do not send your purchase back to the manufacturer.
Refunds
Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.

DISAINITUD JA TOODETUD EESTIS #EELISTAKOHALIKKU
OLEME EESTI MÖÖBLITOOTJASkandinaavialik stiilitunnetus, puhtad ja kerged vormid on kindlasti märksõnad, mis iseloomustavad Oot-Oot Stuudio mööblit. “Meie disainiprotsess on väga pikk. Näiteks Voog tugitoolist sai valmistatud pea poolsada prototüüpi, kuni jõudsime vormi- ja disainitäiuseni, mis annab edasi meie visiooni. Proportsioonid on meie jaoks väga tähtsad!” Kogu tootearendus võttis aega poolteist aastat.
“Diivanid ja Tugitoolid olgu ilusad, kuid sama tähtis on ka ergonoomika!” Ergonoomika on teadus. Iga inimene on erinev ja samuti on erinevad ka inimeste istumisharjumused ja ootused mugavusele. Mõnele sobib jäik ja hästi selga toetav diivan, teisele jälle võimalikult pehme sohva. Seepärast on hea võimalikult palju diivaneid läbi istuda ja leida omale parim lahendus. “Oot-Oot Stuudios oleme jälginud, et erinevad mudelid oleksid erinevate omadustega. Valikust leiab nii pehmeid sulediivaneid kui ka rõhutatud alaseljatoega tugitoole.”

How Our Armchairs Are Made
We build our armchairs up from a hardwood beech frame, using traditional methods and materials. With hand-tied coil-sprung seat, arms and back.
Where cushions are used, what makes them so comfortable is the high down content (50% down, 50% feather in seat, and 70% down, 30% feather in back). The down gives the cushions lovely softness, while the feathers provide loft and spring.​
Where castors are used, they have been individually hand-cast by traditional English metal crafters to a very high standard, and a variety of finishes can be achieved. We use the antique brass finish as standard.
Where legs are used, they can be either tapered or turned and come in a variety of woods and finishes (see 'Leg Options' tab for more details). We use medium oak as standard.
All of our furniture can be made completely bespoke. We want this to be your perfect armchair, so if you want it a bit bigger or smaller, softer or firmer, or anything else just ask we will do our best to accommodate.
The price excludes fabric. If you need some help finding the perfect fabric, let us know. Fabric quantities for standard models in plain fabric are shown in the product description. For patterns, and bespoke sizes, get in touch and we can advise on fabric quantity.

Shipping & Lead Times
The Banyan Tree requires a street address for all deliveries, unfortunately we do not deliver to PO boxes. Deliveries are ONLY door to door and not brought into the premise unless stated otherwise.
Please note that rubbish removal, assembly, placement or unpacking of goods are not included in your shipping quote unless stated otherwise.
Contactless Click & Collect ﻿available in our Camberwell Showroom (Victoria) for ALL items, free.
Free Delivery for specific collections only, such as Ethnicraft.
Flat Rates: We offer the following flat shipping rates:
$15 for all homewares and smaller items,
$70 for all framed prints, canvases, mirrors and larger pieces
PLEASE NOTE THIS IS FOR FULL PRICE ITEMS ONLY.
For sale items, we will contact you directly and provide a quote at competitive prices, however this only applies to metro areas within Australia. We want to ensure your goods arrive safely and with the least chance of damage, so in most cases we will use specialised furniture couriers which may come at a higher price.
If for any reason you cannot be present to accept delivery or if you wish for goods to be left in a safe place unattended, you must clearly make note of this when placing your order. Note: Authority to leave goods unattended will void all transit insurance claims. The Banyan Tree is not liable for theft, damages or loss resulting from your goods being left unattended.
*In the occurrence of a faulty item please report it to us within 48 hours of receiving the item.
Pick up from our Camberwell Showroom is always an option, and it’s free! Customer pickups on large pieces are done so at the bearer's responsibility and damage claims will not be accepted.
Lead times can vary depending on the item, from as little as 1 week or as long as 16 weeks depending on manufacturing and shipping times. An order confirmation will be sent to your email immediately after you place your order, and you will be further advised within 2-5 business days on an estimated time of arrival for your item(s).
We will strive to deliver your items within the specified timeframe, however please note that lead times are an estimate only and they may change due to circumstances beyond our control.
SOLID TIMBER DISCLAIMER
Product images are for illustration purposes only and may differ from the actual product.
You should expect colour, grain and other natural imperfections and variations on natural timber pieces, which is what gives them a unique charm. These will not  be considered damaged pieces.
It is not possible to request a certain colour as all pieces come in their own individual colour and finish. No two pieces will ever be the same.
With solid timber pieces, we can never guarantee 100% that split/cracks will not occur.

Pony is a friendly and characterful addition to any room, but as always, it was designed first and foremost to provide a comfortable seat. Pony has a moulded foam body, feet and ears which are all connected by a tube frame and upholstered in a stretch fabric. Pony chair was designed in 1973 by Eero Aarnio.
We are happy to provide you fabric samples to help you decide the perfect colour for your Pony. You can find our contact information here.

Product Sheet Care Instructions 3D-files
“A chair is a chair, is a chair, is a chair...”
“A chair is a chair, is a chair, is a chair... but a seat does not necessarily have to be a chair. It can be anything as long as it is ergonomically correct. A seat could even be a small and soft Pony on which you can ride or sit sideways. Pony looks like a child’s oversized toy, but its dimensions are suited to adults. We are all big kids, of course.”
The Story of Pony
In 1972 the Aarnios lived in Tontunmäki, where Eero utilized their garage as his work space. Although his previous pieces had already possessed uniqueness and characteristics, Eero describes Pony as his first very unusual design. He thought about chairs. One can sit almost anywhere. A seat doesn’t even have to be a chair or a sofa. One can sit on the stairs, on a rock, on a tree stump, on a horse, on a pony… He decided to design a soft animal figure, which you could sit on, like riding a horse.
In 1973 the first sketch of the Pony was sent to Asko Furniture company, who was the main producer of Eero Aarnio’s designs. They completed the basic form for the seat and sent it by bus to Puumala, where Eero continued developing the prototype at the Aarnio family’s summer cottage. Eero thought the first mold was decent but needed enhancing. In the country side, there was plenty of space to work, and since the body was made of polystyrene, he didn’t mind getting his hands and surroundings all over it. Eero bought some modeling clay and worked further with the body. After the basic form was finished, he painted the first Pony white.
From the start Eero knew the Pony needed upholstering. The process for the upholsterer is extremely challenging and difficult, requiring rare talent in hand crafting. As a result, one can only admire the magnificent seaming, intertwining together with the form of the body and flexibility of the fabric. However, some Ponys out there do not have their ‘furs’. Batches has been produced of concrete to serve as road blocks. Ponys made of concrete are not easily moved around, since they weigh as much as 250kg.
Eero Aarnio’s Pony is no regular chair. The designer himself prefers to rather call it a seat. Eero designed the Pony first and foremost to provide a comfortable form. The size came out of ergonomics, it is the perfect height for back and feet to rest. One can ride it or sit sideways on it. Eero initially designed the smaller size for children, however, the young have always been as keen on to climb on the larger Pony. It looks like a child’s oversized toy, even though the dimensions are designed for adults. “We are all big kids, of course”, says Eero Aarnio.
Pony is often referred to as intriguing the inner child in adults. Eero’s design aesthetics have a certain playfulness and humor, which have been very salient in his creativity and thinking process. Eero believes certain pieces should have a certain personality, one that suits them perfectly. For example, color is a key part of the message and a way of communicating for Eero. For the Pony, Eero prefers the colors green and white. Although, speaking from experience, for a family with children, white can be quite sensitive…

Refund Policy
Returns
You may return an unused, un-installed, undamaged item with its original box and packaging in new condition within 14 days of delivery for a refund less our shipping costs (even if it was a free shipping promotion listing).
All returns MUST be authorized by us with a RAM#.
Please note that it usually takes us 2-4 business days to process returns after they arrive at our location. We will notify you via e-mail after the return is processed.
Damages
To provide a safer transit, all large and heavy items are boxed with protective Styrofoam and heavy duty cardboard edges. Top and bottom are also reinforced for extra safety measures. Shipments will also be shrink-wrapped, and they are always strapped down to pallets when shipped via LTL freight carrier for stability.
Even with all of the extra measures we take to ensure a safe and complete transit , nonetheless, damages or shortage may still occur. In case such an event should occur, in order for us to replace any item(s) free of charge or issue a credit, we ask you to inspect all boxes and note any damage/shortage on the delivery receipt (driver's copy). After the driver leaves, please open and inspect all items; and report to us if there are any problems on the item(s) immediately. Please be sure to keep all the original packaging for any returns.
Please inspect the outside of each box and note any damage/shortage when signing the delivery receipt! Delivery receipt is a binding contract. By signing the receipt without any notation of damage/shortage, the customer is stating that all items are in 100% good condition, inside and out, and agree to release all liabilities from us (the seller) and the freight carrier. Upon arrival, if there are any shortages or damages, regardless how minor, you must make a note on the delivery receipt when you sign for your shipment. Failure to note shipping damage will result in our inability to offer an exchange, return or refund.
All damages/shortages must be reported to us with supporting photos within 5 days from the date of receipt, so that we can file a claim for your replacement. Please be sure to keep all the original packaging of the shipment for any return.
Refusing delivery for any non-damage or non-defect reason, at our discretion, is subject to a 15% restocking fee and the shipping costs from and to our warehouse.
Any insurance claim without a damage/shortage note on the driver's delivery receipt will be declined by the freight carrier, and so no refund or replacement can be made.

How soon will it ship?
How quickly will I get my order? (production or lead time)
At Oak For Less® furniture, we offer furniture from many different builders.  Some are right here in Phoenix, AZ, while others are in California, Wisconsin or the midwest like Illinois or Indiana.  Many of our domestic items are made-to-order and are built when the order is placed, so their production time is a little longer than others.  We also offer a selection of items that are imported, so they often have quicker production times since those items are already made.
Since lead times can vary, we give an estimated range.  These lead times are APPROXIMATE, they are NOT EXACT.  Items may arrive early or unexpected delays can occur with builders and/or shippers.  These situations are beyond our control.  By placing an order, the customer agrees that they understand the production time is our best estimate.  When the order is ready for In-Store Pick Up or Local Delivery, you will receive a call to schedule it.
Current estimated lead time is per builder item # prefix.For example, item FD-3051T has an "FD-" at the beginning of its item #.  On our list below, FD- items have a lead time of 8 - 12 weeks.  So item FD-3051T has a lead time of 8 - 12 weeks.  Please remember this is an ESTIMATE and many factors can affect it.
If your delivery location is outside of Arizona please add at least 2 weeks extra to these estimates to allow for the shipper's scheduling and routing delivery arrangements.  Also, if the delivery location is in a remote location or an area not easily reached by the delivery service, it may take an extended delivery time.

Shipping information
Good news!  We now offer nation-wide delivery for most products (we have shipped all over the U.S.  We do not currently have a shipper to do Alaska nor Hawaii, and do not have international shipping (sorry!).  We work with different shippers and they each have their own designated delivery areas of the U.S. - some areas may not be available, so please contact us to inquire about delivery to your area.
The shopping cart will automatically calculate the type of delivery depending on the item(s) and delivery location.
Delivery services are made by experienced independent contractors. Delivery is available if the customer is located within designated delivery areas. Delivery contractors do their best to be careful when delivering furniture, but in the event damage occurs to walls, flooring, etc., the customer will take up any issues solely with the independent contractor.
Customers must have the room ready for the delivery when it is scheduled. Delivery does NOT include moving old furniture or electronic devices such as TVs or audio/video components. If you ask them to do extra work, they will charge extra.
With any delivery method, the customer is responsible for making sure that the items will fit through their hallways and into the room of choice. If the driver cannot easily deliver it to the room of choice (narrow hallways/tight turns/low ceilings/is asked to move other furniture) there will be additional cost that must be paid to the delivery service at the time of the delivery.

Rising temperatures often tempt us to think of being outdoors rather than inside. So make it an extension of your indoor living space by transforming outdoor space into a harmonious area by adding unique patio furniture and garden decor pieces. We have the perfect mix to help you brighten up your outdoor space while complementing your indoor space. Because once it's wholly decorated, you'll find yourself naturally gravitating to it. \u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eOur outdoor furniture is constructed and refinished to hold up to outdoor elements with materials featuring reclaimed teak wood, repurposed metal fixtures, and upcycled zinc. In addition, we have an eclectic selection with lots of different decor styles.

Light the candles and set out trays for self-serving. By placing a bucket of ice filled with beverages on the table, guests will be drawn to that area. Decorate the space with colourful accents to add to the ambience. \u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eAccessorize.

How To Choose The Perfect Coffee Table
Choosing a coffee table for your living area sounds like it should be fairly easy. Start by visiting your favourite stores, in-person or online, and begin the search where you're presented with an abundance of options in various shapes, sizes, and finishes. Each option looks appealing in their mock-up space but will it work for yours? Plus, these curated rooms look great but haven't been lived in or stood up to the challenge of accommodating take away in front of the television and managing drinks, remote controls, tech devices, treasured trinkets, or game nights.

Moo
HK$23,880.00
Moo is a full scale wall–mounted Norwegian moose head light. Moo may be used for both indoor and outdoor decoration. The figuratively shaped lamp body is made of poly–resin material, that gives a smooth and transparent flow of light. The bulbs placed inside the horns add extra elements of soft, sparkling and translucent light effects to the lamp.
The inspiration behind the Moo lamp was found in northern Norway, –in the breathtaking scenery of Hamarøy, where both designers have summer houses. Here the moose is frequently seen passing close to the houses and even on the lawns. The designers hope Moo will stand out as a post–modern kitch trophy, making the viewer smile happily as they recognize this “King of the Norwegian forest”.

Welcome to Modern Furniture
Established in 2001, Modern Furniture specializes in manufacturing, importing, and distributing designer-style furniture for both residential and commercial settings nationwide. We take great care to source our products globally, ensuring they are crafted with quality materials, expert craftsmanship, and exquisite designs. Our goal is to provide our customers our exclusive furniture at unbeatable prices.
Delivering nationwide, we specialize in large fitouts, catering to a wide range of customers, including many large and reputable brands.
At Modern Furniture, we pride ourselves on our commitment to quality and design excellence, making us the perfect partner for those looking to create a stylish and functional space.
Explore the Modern Furniture Range
At Modern Furniture, we believe that décor is about more than just appearances. It's about creating a certain feel in your interior spaces – a feeling of sophistication, elegance, and style.
...
With an ever-growing range of contemporary furniture, Modern Furniture is your one-stop shop for all your furniture needs. From the latest in contemporary dining tables and chairs to the latest in living room furniture, we have it all.
With a massive range of styles available online and in-store, we’re your one-stop shop for all your furniture needs. So, what are you waiting for? Browse our exclusive, designer range today.
Your Online Furniture Store in Australia
When it comes to contemporary style, there is a lot to explore at our online furniture store. We offer a wide range of design choices, from sofas and coffee tables, to office furniture and lounge chairs. We also offer a range of accessories, such as lamps, rugs and cushions, to complete the look.
We’re an Australian family-owned business that designs and manufactures our own designer furniture, then delivers it nationwide. Here at our store, there are two main styles of furniture design: mid-century modern and contemporary. Mid-century style is characterised by its clean lines, simple forms, and natural materials. Contemporary furniture, on the other hand, is more often defined by its use of bold colours, patterns, and artwork, as well as cutting-edge materials.
We celebrate both of these here at Modern Furniture. We travel the world looking for beautiful decor, with a range of timeless pieces crafted from quality materials. Browse our exclusive collection today.
So Which is the Right Style of Furniture for You?
It really depends on your personal taste and the overall aesthetic you're going for. Whether you’re creating a cosy feel in your home, or going for a professional look at the office, we have everything you need to make a great first impression.
Of course, you don't have to choose just one style. Mixing and matching different pieces is a great way to put together an eclectic look and create a truly unique space. You’re only limited by your imagination. Check out our range for inspiration today to get started.
Stunning Contemporary Furniture in Australia
No matter what your personal style, you're sure to find something you love at Modern Furniture. We carry a wide range of both mid-century modern and contemporary furniture, so you're sure to find the perfect piece for your home.
Got a question about our designer range or have your eye on a specific product or style? Reach out to us on 1800 023 466 or via email at sales@modernfurniture.com.au. Our helpful customer service team is always available to chat.

Marie France R.Bed is great but the customer service was a complete disaster. Staff called me to place an order when I was a customer. They also did not mention that they cannot deliver on certain days. Those days should be mentioned in the check-out notes where they ask you which days are suitable for delivery. I also asked for a Manager and they never transferred me to one. It was horrid.

Design By
LARS WENDELBO
Since 1955, when the Wendelbo furniture business was founded in Aarhus Denmark, Upholsterer and founder Tage Petersen had a goal of producing custom-made sofas using the old-fashioned styles of craftmanship and incorporating values such as quality, precision and pride. With the next generation of design leadership under Lars Wendelbo, the company has innovated into what it is today with a renewed sense of urban-contemporary Danish design that is timeless in its appeal.

Well built product The TV stand is well built and of better quality than some of the others I’ve seen.

Ada TV stand welcome in our home At first I wanted to buy the smaller Ida stand but then decided the Ada is a bit larger and taller and better suited.
Although there is no holes in the open display shelves of this unit I easily drilled 3 holes, one for cables and 2 more for ventilation and it looks neat. Happy with the space of the top for TV and soundbar and 2 lamps to the side. It is a basic but neat unit, and fits in with a modern style and laminate flooring (but it will do fine in any room and flooring type)

description
The Chieut table, a contemporary low table, has been described as the quintessential minimalist design project. Originally conceived by Swedish based South Korean designer Jay Design in 2012, this beautiful ethereal piece seems to defy the law of gravity. The Chieut has attracted the praise of leading architectural luminaries such as the Zaha Hadid Architects and was the recipient of the prestigious Golden A' Design Award in 2017.
The Chieut table is entirely handcrafted in Italy by design atelier Minimaproject with the finest materials in a limited edition of 200 pieces to guarantee the uniqueness of each piece. Both body and legs can be ordered in a number of powder coating colour finishes to obtain interesting cromatic combinations. Small imperfections might be present-evidence that our pieces are unique and not mass produced.

Based in Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne, Walter Cox Ltd has been a family business for 104 years. It was Walter Cox himself who started the business as a watch maker in 1918 after he'd served in the First World War, the shop was originally based in Church Street then moved to the current site on Welbeck Road in 1935. Douglas Cox took over from him followed by David Cox, Walter's sons.  David and his wife, Kathleen, retired 16 years ago and now Samantha, their daughter, and her husband John, run the shop.  Over the years the shop has sold many different products including paint, prams, clothes and shoes. Long before Netflix and Firesticks, you could forget about Blockbusters, Walter Cox was the place to go for all your rental videos.
Through the years the shop has changed what it sells to keep up with current trends and fashions, one thing that has not changed is the pride we take in our customer service to all our existing and new customers.
Today the shop sells a wide range of household furniture, beds, carpets and household electricals from leading brands such as Hotpoint, Indesit, Whirlpool, Lifestyle Floors, Dura Beds and Julian Bowen.

Fabric Wardrobe, Foldable Closet with Hanging Rail, Clothes Rack, Storage Organiser for Bags, Toys, Shoes, Living Room, Bedroom, Cloakroom, 150 x 45 x 175 cm.
INVITE YOUR CLOTHES IN: Hang your clothes on the 2 rods of the fabric wardrobe in neat rows. Place your folded clothes on the shelves. When you need to pick your outfits for a big day, everything you have is just at your fingertips.
IT HAS THE STRENGTH: The hanging rail has a load capacity of 15 kg and the fabric layer holds 5 kg because it’s supported by 16 mm dia. metal tubes and quality non-woven fabric; the sturdiness and durability of the foldable closet are both assured.
AWAY FROM DUST: Your favorite new garment needs better protection. The fabric cover, equipped with a zipper and hook-and-loop fasteners, was handpicked to store your clothes properly. This clothes rack has you covered!
EASY TO ASSEMBLE: No more spending hours putting a fabric wardrobe together; the assembly here is all about attaching the tubes into the plastic connectors, no tools required. All that’s left to do is display your shirts and dresses on the hanging rail.

You never know exactly what you're going to get when you order one of our Myrtlewood lazy Susans, but you are always getting your money's worth.  The variation is quite drastic as you can see in the pictures.  This is probably my most favorite wood to work with because of the surprise I get when the character finally shows through upon final sanding and lacquer coats.
The 16 inch solid Myrtle lazy susan comes standard with a 6" steel swivel base.  Premium swivel base upgrades are available.  Click here to access my premium swivel base order page.

Classic pieces will always be an asset because each item will enhance and anchor a room. Western Australia has much to offer in regards to land, coastline and open space therefore homes can reflect all these elements whether the dwelling is a tiny French-inspired cottage with carefully chosen furnishings or a sprawling Hamptons style house filled with ocean driftwood-inspired colours and lots of light.
